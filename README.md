# Diabetes in USA: *Who is at risk?*

Non-communicable diseases dominate disease burden within the developed world; diabetes has the seventh largest disease burden in the United States and continues to grow year-by-year. [[1]](https://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-compare/) Like most non-communicable diseases, genetic, lifestyle, and community factors differentially potentiate diabetes incidence. **To advocate effectively for diabetes as a public health burden, one must determine the communities most affected by it, the underlying medical risk factors that increase the likelihood of development, and its current maintenance and treatment methods.** In this capstone project, we are creating a holistic narrative of the disease burden of diabetes in the United States from a public health perspective. First, CDC [[2]](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cdc/national-health-and-nutrition-examination-survey) [[3]](https://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpao/data-trends-maps/index.html) [[4]](https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/Chronic-Disease-Indicators/U-S-Chronic-Disease-Indicators-Diabetes/f8ti-h92k/data), Census [[5]](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=education%20by%20state&tid=ACSDT5Y2020.B06009) [[6]](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=S1901&tid=ACSST5Y2020.S1901), and Department of Agriculture [[7]](https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food-nutrition-assistance/food-security-in-the-u-s/interactive-charts-and-highlights/) data are used to determine who is most affected by diabetes, including special interest explorations of race, ethnicity, sex, age, income, food security, and exercise. Second, the Rui-Ci Health Center's diabetes and medical characteristics dataset [[8]](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.ft8750v) is used in machine learning models to predict the underlying physical characteristics that coincide with diabetes diagnoses, emphasizing the connection between community demographics and health manifestations. Third, deep learning techniques are used on Jaeb Center blood glucose traces [[9]](https://public.jaeb.org/dataset/563) to develop a tool for tracking and alerting diabetic individuals of blood glucose spikes, thus creating a holistic view of diabetes patients pre- and post-diagnosis. All project methods emphasize the use of cheap data science techniques to refine and target diabetes disease burden control within the United States, with special emphasis on creating a holistic view of diabetes from a public health perspective. The findings of this project can then be used for efficient and effective targeted advocacy for those most affected.

This capstone project is the creation of [**Temesgen Fekadu**](https://github.com/TemesgenFekadu01), [**Jack Lynn**](https://github.com/jackrlynn3), [**Hayden Muscha**](https://github.com/HaydenKMuscha), and [**Sam Wainright**](https://github.com/wainrightsamantha), in coordination with the [**Dev10 Data Bootcamp**](https://www.genesis10.com/).

#### Essential Questions
1. Which demographics are most likely to develop diabetes in the US?  
2. What measurable bodily attributes contribute to the indication of diabetes?  
3. How are diabetes patients' blood glucose levels tracked in real time?  
4. Which demographics are exhibiting higher spikes in blood glucose levels?  
5. Looking at specific regions within the US, how do different lifestyles contribute to diabetes prevalence?  
6. Does food scarcity impact diabetes incidence?  
7. Can we predict diabetes diagnoses based on readily available medical vitals, such as blood pressure, mineral levels, and body mass index? 
8. Can we predict warning notifications for dangerous blood glucose spikes based on real time blood glucose levels of Type-1 diabetes patients?
